#PROJECT DATA DIG - TOP COUNTRIES BY POPULATION - use advanced SELECT queries to discover things about the data.

# used  average, max, and min values in the data
# numbers per category in the data (using HAVING)
# used ways to group the data values that donâ€™t exist yet (using CASE)
# interesting ways are there to filter the data (using AND/OR)

/* Put your data in here and query it! */
